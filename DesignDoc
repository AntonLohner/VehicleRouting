What will our program need? : Option 1) We take the adresses given to us by the server, 

Capacity Constraints - Number of cars, how much they can pick up.
Time Windows - When and Where the packages need to be delivered.
Places to go - A time matrix of different locations, hopefully delivered by google maps API


What will our program do? :

What libraries do you think will be useful? :

What are the decisions that must be taken? : Time vs Precision, 


Inputs-

Distance matrix, data['distance_matrix'] = [[num],[num]]. (To get this, see https://developers.google.com/optimization/routing/vrp#distance_matrix_api)
data['num_vehicles'] = 4
data['depot'] = 0 // (which of the distances is the central hub)
demands -  volume of the customer's request
capacities- how much  volume the car can hold 
time windows- When the customer is available to recieve the package - A pain, but can be done.
num_locations??
slack_max -> How long they wait in each home, at max.
depot_capacity 
vehicle_load_time
vehicle_unload_time


Functions -

Distance_Callback -> Returns the distance between two nodes (takes it from the matrix)
Distance Dimension -> Computes the cumulative distance traveled
Solution_Printer-> Prints the solution to console (We're going to modify this to output a JSON)
//

data ={}
has: distance_matrix, num_locations, num_vehicles, depot



Step 1: https://developers.google.com/optimization/routing/vrp and https://developers.google.com/optimization/routing/vrp#distance_matrix_api
Step 2: We need to add CVRP afterwards (capacity, some packages heavier, etc) https://developers.google.com/optimization/routing/cvrp
Step 3: We add time windows to our demands if needed (https://developers.google.com/optimization/routing/vrptw)
Step 4: Resource Constraints (Loading, mostly) (https://developers.google.com/optimization/routing/cvrptw_resources)
Step 5: Do we need to add drop penalties? Do we even drop packages? - Might have to when we add time windows.
Step 6: Search limits, solution limits, time limits. Do we want to input an initial route? Probably not, but who knows?


Q:

How does accessing a file work in a server?



Static Map vs Javascript Map

In order to visualize the routing

https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/directions-simple
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/directions-complex
gives us an example of a javascript map with directions
i'm worried that having so many directions at the same time will either cause massive request amounts, or be unfeasible. 

Zoom of 10 or 11. The markers will zoom it in anyways, but it's good to have a good start.
Center at our location usually. In our example we'll use the hub there, but it'll be the static enviaflores place
